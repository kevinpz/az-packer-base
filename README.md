> Deploy an Azure Image Compute Gallery using Terraform

## Important notes
* The pipeline file is for Azure DevOps
* You need to have a storage account already existing to store the .tfstate remotely
* The Terraform tasks are using the [Azure Pipelines Terraform Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charleszipp.azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform) extension
